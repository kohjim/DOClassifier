# DOClassifier v1.0

A tool to classify lake free surface DO observations

## Getting Started

A manual to come soon.

Web based version is available from: http://kmuraoka.com/DOClassifier/ 

### Note for linux users

"Error java.lang.ClassNotFoundException" may appear on linux machine, which is reportedly an issue of environmental settings of rJava. Executing “export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/jre/lib/amd64/:/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/jre/lib/amd64/server” and “sudo R CMD javareconf” fixed the issue in our Ubuntu server, but if that is difficult, please use the web version for now.
